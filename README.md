### **Introduction**

The project "HUFLIT Scholarship Analysis and Prediction" is a comprehensive data science and data analytics solution designed to analyze and predict student rewards based on academic and behavioral performance. The primary objective is to streamline the scholarship allocation process by leveraging machine learning to provide data-driven insights and automate predictions.

This is the user's first project using ChatGPT's assistance, demonstrating the integration of advanced AI technologies into real-world applications. The project utilizes Python for data preprocessing, visualization, and model training, and integrates Streamlit to provide an interactive web-based prediction tool.
